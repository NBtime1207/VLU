            <li><b>Installation</b></li>
            <li><b>Meet Laravel</b></li>
            Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax.
            <li><b>Why Laravel?</b></li>
            There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web
            application.
            <li><b>A Progressive Framework</b></li>
            We like to call Laravel a progressive framework. By that, we mean that Laravel
            grows with you.
            <li><b>A Scalable Framework</b></li>
            Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and
            Laravels built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal
            scaling with Laravel is a breeze.
            <li><b>Your First Laravel Project</b></li>
            Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine
            has PHP and Composer installed.
            <li><b>Laravel & Docker</b></li>
            <li><b>Getting Started On macOS</b></li>
            If youre developing on a Mac and Docker Desktop is already installed, you can use
            a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project.
            <li><b>Getting Started On Windows</b></li>
            Before we create a new Laravel application on your Windows machine, make sure
            to install Docker Desktop.
            <li><b>Getting Started On Linux</b></li>
            If youre developing on Linux and Docker Compose is already installed, you can use
            a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project.
            <li><b>Choosing Your Sail Services</b></li>
            When creating a new Laravel application via Sail, you may use the with query string
            variable to choose which services should be configured in your new applications
            docker-compose.yml file.
